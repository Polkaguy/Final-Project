# CS109 Final Project

Hey team. I'm going to apologize in advance for not being to familiar with GitHub. I only use it for school and this is my first group project. I'm assuming that we will have one document file for our reporting and one or more Jupyter notebooks for our analyses. As the time gets closer, we can collaborate on how we all best work in this environment. I'm looking forward to working with you all.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
